# PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### Segway-Ninebot
*Data Analyst Intern* summer 2023

*	Utilized Hive and SQL to analyze over 100,000 event-tracking data samples from the testing team, identifying and addressing abnormal data issues. Collaborated with the testing team to improve event tracking standards.

*	Developed foundational computational logic and created an interactive and linkage Induction Unlock Success Rate Analysis Dashboard using PowerBI, visualizing success rates across various dimensions.

*	Optimized the APP Event Tracking Dashboard by refining key performance indicators to enhance dashboard performance.

### China Securities 
*Quantitative Analysis Intern* 01/2023-03/2023

* Reduced data dimensions using unsupervised learning methods and identified significant influencing factors with the Multidimensional Optimum Seeking Method using Python.

*	Developed a prediction model with supervised learning techniques, achieving a 95% accuracy rate in estimating stock futures price changes, and optimized the factor library, improving algorithm efficiency by 90%.


# Research & Academic Experiences

### Students' Attitudes Toward Statistics, Perceived Math Ability, and Instructor's Pedagogy Effect on Grades 08/2023-09/2024

*	Applied Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Ordinal Logistic Regression model using R to examine relationships between students' grades and responses to the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) questions.

*	Investigated the impact of professors' degrees and teaching methodologies on student performance using Nested Effect analysis and Welch Two Sample t-test.

*	Implemented tree-based models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) and Ordinal Logistic Regression models in R, utilizing Cross-Validation to select the optimal analytical model for students' final grades.

*	Presented findings at the Joint Statistical Meeting in August 2024.


### Wine Quality Evaluation Fall 2023
*	Constructed a correlation matrix using Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient to analyze relationships between chemical attributes in the wine using R.

*	Selected variables using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) method to establish a model exploring the relationships between wine quality and chemical attributes, and to predict wine type.

*	Tested the established model with XGBoost (Classification and Logistic Regression) and evaluated performance using a Confusion Matrix, achieving an accuracy of 99.48%.
